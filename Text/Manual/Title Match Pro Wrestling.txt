                               TITLE MATCH(tm)
                                Pro Wrestling




                          FOR THE ATARI(r) 7800(tm)




TONIGHT'S THE NIGHT

     '...the screams of the crowd shake the arena as the Title Belt contenders 
circle one another.  Mad Dog makes the first move smashing his fists into Skin 
Head's chest who gasps for air, then retaliates with a shin cracking kick.  
Mad Dog growls and grabbing from behind drags Skin Head across the ring 
whipping him around in an airplane spin;  letting go so he flys into the ropes 
and bounces back to meet Mad Dog's concrete forearm across his neck...a 
perfectly executed clothesline.  Wasting no time Mad Dog elbow drops him.  
Skin Head's face winces in pain as he fights his way up and staggers to his 
corner to tag his partner in.  Big Chief takes the tag, grabs Mad Dog lifting 
him over his head and body slams him into the mat.  Mad Dog's stunned, he's 
not getting up.  Big Chief, looking for the pin, climbs the ropes for a dive.  
As he lunges into the air, Mad Dog scrambles to his feet and Big Chief's 
sweaty red skinned body splatters on the empty mat...'



                                 INSTRUCTIONS


                                   TO BEGIN

1.  With the power off, insert the TITLE MATCH(tm) cartridge into your 
    Atari(r) 7800(tm) game system according to manufacturer's instructions.

2.  Plug joystick into port labeled "left controller" for one player; another 
    into port labeled "right controller" for two players.

3.  Turn power on.

4.  Press "SELECT" to go to the selection screen.  The message at the top of 
    the screen displays the type of match currently selected:


<screenshot of the selection screen with the 4 wrestlers>


 1 One on one-Two Player
 2 Tag team-2 player
*3 One on one-One player
*4 Tag team-One player
*You play against the computer


Pressing "SELECT" will cycle you through the match selections.  Once you have 
selected a match, choose your wrestlers beginning with player No. 1 (the 
person using the left joystick).  Move the joystick to highlight your 
selection and then press the joystick button.  Once player No. 1 has selected 
a wrestler, it is player No. 2's turn.  In a tag team match, this selection 
occurs twice.  The contenders are from left to right:


<picture of black guy, white bald guy, white hairy guy with mask, and an 
indian with a mohawk>


Mad Dog - From Mad Dog, Louisiana, and weighing in at a whopping 390 lbs., 
this redneck husky vows to "chew up and spit out" anyone who tries to tangle 
with him.

Skin Head - Weighing in at 265 lbs., from Cowpoke, Idaho, this farmboy was 
brutally forced to shave his head after losing in a cow-tipping contest.  To 
overcome his humiliation, Skin Head turned to wrestling at the age of 9, and 
today is one of the most feared wrestlers of our time.

Mr. Mean - Currently weighing in at 320 lbs., from Hoboken, New Jersey, Mr. 
Mean acquired virtually all of his early training on the streets, defending 
himself against slime.

Big Chief - One part Apache and one part hulk, from Big River, Utah, he is 
merciless at 420 lbs.  Big Chief pow wow doesn't miss a trick - he will crush 
you without a second's thought.

5.  Once contenders have been chosen, the arena screen is displayed and the 
    match can begin.  At any point during gameplay, pressing "RESET" will 
    restart the currently selected match.


                               TAKING THE BELT

Each wrestler's strength is displayed by power bars on the scoreboard.  The 
upper bar represents the strength of wrestler No. 1 (left joystick), and the 
lower bar represents the strength of wrestler No. 2 (right joystick or 
computer).  Your challenge wil be to sustain your strength while depleting 
your opponent's.  Strength, used in combination with skillful maneuvering will 
enable you to pin your opponent.  Next to each wrestler's power bar is a digit 
representing how many times the opposition has fallen.  Pinning your opponent 
for 3 counts will constitute a fall.  The rule for winning a match is best out 
of three falls.


                                YOUR CONTROLS

There are two modes of joystick control used during gameplay.  The first is 
"joystick mode", which is simply moving the joystick around.  Your wrestler's 
movement or pattern will correspond to that of your joystick.  The second is 
"button mode".  To switch from joystick into button mode you must first 
release the joystick.  Then press the button and use one of the four joystick 
positions to execute the move.  To use button mode in succession, you must 
release both the button and the joystick and then press the button and move 
the joystick again.  The following instructions will refer to button mode as 
either "button mode up, down, right or left."


                           SOFTENING YOUR OPPONENT

Once the match begins, your wrestlers can walk around the ring in joystick 
mode.  Make your wrestler punch with button mode up, and kick with button mode 
down.  You can "soften" your opponent with these moves by knocking down his 
strength, while maintaining your own.


                                THE HEAD LOCK

With the exception of punching and kicking, you must first grab your opponent 
into a head lock before making a move against him.  Do this by moving your 
wrestler right next to his opponent, release the joystick, and in button mode, 
grab by directing the joystick toward the opponent.  (To release your opponent 
you must re-activate button mode, this time directing the joystick toward your 
own wrestler).  Once you have captured your opponent in a head lock, you can 
drag him around the ring in joystick mode.  Using button mode down, canvas 
slam your opponent.


                             "AROUND HE GOES..."

While you have him in a head lock, direct the joystick towards your opponent 
in button mode to swing him into an airplane spin.  Switch to joystick mode by 
releasing the button and throw your opponent.  You can swing your opponent 
just a little bounce him off the rops or swing him him around many times and 
then let go to send him bouncing into the ropes and then flying back across 
the ring!  When your opponent bounces off the ropes, get in his path and press 
the button before he passes you to clothesline him and knock him to the 
canvas.  

NOTE:  When caught in a head lock, you must use Muscle Mode to generate the 
extra power needed to escape.  See Muscle Mode.


<screenshot of Skin Head about to land on Mr. Mean>


                              "HE'S FLYING HIGH"

To power lift your opponent, get him into a head lock and use button mode up.  
Once he is overhead, use joystick mode to carry your opponent around the ring.
Using button mode up, you can back drop and pin your opponent.  Or - use 
button mode down for a body slam.  Carry your opponent to one of the top 
corners of the ring and use button mode down to throw him out of the ring.


                                "HE'S DOWN..."

With your opponent down, in joystick mode you can walk freely around the ring.
Position your wrestler right next to his opponent and use button mode up to 
power lift him, or use button mode left or right to grab him into a head lock.
Use button mode down to elbow drop and pin your opponent.

NOTE:  When a wrestler is down, he can use Muscle Mode to generate the 
additional strength needed to get back up.  See Muscle Mode.


                           "HE'S UP ON THE ROPES!"

If your opponent is down and you are away from him at the very top or very 
bottom of the ring, you can climb onto the ropes using button mode up.  Once 
on the ropes, joystick mode left or right allows you to walk back and forth.  
Use button mode down to climb off of the ropes, or use button mode up to do a 
rope dive and pin your opponent.  


                       SWITCHING WITH TAG TEAM PARTNERS

When competing in a tag team match, move your wrestler to his corner at the 
bottom of the ring and use button mode down to switch with your tag partner.  
A good time to do this is when your strength is down, but remember that your 
partner must be at maximum strength in order to switch.  You can tell that 
your partner's strength is up by walking near your corner.  If your partner 
attempts to follow you, then he has fully regained his strength.


                                 MUSCLE MODE

When you opponent is down or in a head lock, he can escape by putting "muscle 
mode" into action.  Muscle mode is executed by jiggling the joystick left and 
right very fast.  Jiggling the joystick provides extra strength to be used in 
combination with the wrestler's already existing strength.  The following are 
situations in which you will find it necessary to utilize muscle mode:

*  When your opponent has gotten you into a head lock - if your strength 
   combined with your extra power from using muscle mode exceeds the strength 
   of your opponent, you can break away.  Example:  if you have more strength 
   than your opponent and he grabs you, minimal muscle will be needed for you 
   to break away.

*  To get back up when you are down on the canvas - if you already have at 
   least half of your strength, little muscle is needed to get back up.  With 
   less than half your strength available, you must work harder in muscle mode 
   to get back up.

*  When you are pinned - if your strength combined with the extra muscle 
   generated by using muscle mode exceeds that of your opponent, you will 
   succeed in escaping.  

*  When you have your opponent pinned - in this situation, muscle mode is used 
   offensively.  This is a muscle mode competition, in which you, the 
   aggressor, are trying to maintain your pin for three seconds, while your 
   opponent is trying to escape.


                 <picture of the Absolute Championship belt>


                  SOME STRATEGIC ADVICE FROM THE EXPERTS...

*  Keep in mind that certain offensive moves, such as power lifting, or 
   holding your opponent in an airplane spin for an extended period of time 
   will use up a lot of your own strength, while increasing your opponent's.  
   Try to use less expensive moves such as punching and kicking to soften your 
   opponent, so that when the time comes, you will have enough strength to pin 
   him.

*  Pin your opponent unexpectedly to get a head start in Muscle Mode 
   competition.

*  In tag team competition, if you know that your opponent's tag partner is 
   weak, throw your opponent out of the ring.  This will force his partner 
   into the ring, allowing you to take advantage of the competition's weakened 
   condition.

*  In tag team competition, if you know that your opponent is weak, guard his 
   corner to prevent him from switching with his tag team partner.
