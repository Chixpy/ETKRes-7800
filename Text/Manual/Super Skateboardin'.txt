                              Super
                          SKATEBOARDIN'



                       Instruction Manual


TO BEGIN

1)  With power off, insert the Super Skateboardin' cartridge into your game 
system according to the manufacturer's instructions.

2)  Plus joystick into port labeled "left controller."

3)  Turn power on.

4)  Press RESET to begin the game.  (At any point during the game, press RESET 
to begin again.)


  Start at the factory door with your skateboard.  Press RESET to begin.  You 
can walk by moving the joystick in the direction you want to go.  (What boarder
wants to do that!)  Instead, go to your skateboard (which you automatically 
pick up) run and jump on (by pressing the joystick button).
  Once on the board, use the joystick to move right or left.  Press the button 
to jump.  Hold the joystick down to crouch.
  As you speed through the factory, pass each machine to automatically turn it 
off.  You'll have to jump to turn off those light bulbs though.  Hint:  Time 
your lift-off perfectly and you'll get all three in one hit.  If you want to 
pass a machine that's already turned off jump over it or else you'll turn it 
back on.  (Except for light bulbs, once they're off, they're off.)
  The factory is one giant maze!  Tubes are the only way to get from floor to 
floor.  But yoou've got to find the right tubes.  Different tubes go to 
different floors.  To ride a tube hold the joystick down to crouch, enter the 
tube, and release.  If you want to change your mind in the middle, don't 
release the joystick until you're heading back in the direction you came from.
  The right difficulty switch turns the game music on and off.  O.K. boarders 
start cruisin'!


THE CRUISE

  Your Dad got you an afterschool job at the factory where he works.  You need 
the money 'cuz being the most radical boarder around means you've got heavy 
expenses.
  The job is a skateboarder's dream come true.  Miles of halls and tubes to 
perfect your moves.  Just cruise through and turn off all the machines and 
lights in the factory.  Hurry up 'cuz power is leaking out fast!
  Naturally, there's a catch.  You get paid depending on how much power you 
save.  And you've got to be out of the factory by 5:15 pm today.  One second 
more and you'll never make the deadline for entering the Skateboarding 
Championship.
  Look at the bottom of your screen to see how radical you truly are.  The left
meter shows the power consumption of the machines and equipment you haven't 
turned off yet.  The middle meter tells how much power has been used since you 
started.  As you turn off machines and equipment, power consumption slows.  The
right meter ticks away the minutes you have left.  Check out the ratings at the
end of the instructions to see how radical your cruisin' rates!

TIPS FROM THE PROS

                          <2 screenshots of the game>

  The assembly lines drain the most power. Find them first.  'Cuz your boss 
gets angry when electric bills are too high.
  If you want to max out your speed, head for an assembly line.  Pull down on 
your joystick twice to get off your board and pick it up.  Make a running start
and jump on the assembly line.  (You've got to time your hit perfectly to avoid
getting squashed by the plungers.)  Run on top of the machine and jump off at 
the end of the line.  Now you're really cruisin'!  This trick will totally 
speed up your moves, unless you fall off your board.
  Watch the doors in each room.  An open door means you have been in the room 
before and have checked out the machines.  A closed door means you haven't 
gotten to the room yet.  Get in there, dude, and turn that power off!
  Be careful on the roof.  Get too close to the edge and you and your board 
will do a nose dive to the ground!
  By the way, there are rumors of a truly radical skateboarder who finished his
factory job in just four-and-one-half minutes.  Are you more awesome than 
that?!
