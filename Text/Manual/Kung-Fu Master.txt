                              KUNG-FU MASTER

          The gorgeous Princess Victoria is imprisoned in
          the Evil Wizard's Temple.  As Kung-Fu Master, you
          must free her.  Unfortunately, the Temple's five     
          tortuous levels are seething with menacing foes.     
          Smash your way through one level and start the       
          next with a renewed energy meter and timer.          
          Once you free your Princess, it's back to the        
          beginning where your foes return faster and nastier. 



                              Getting Started

    1.  Turn game system power switch OFF.

    2.  Insert the Kung-Fu Master cartridge as directed in your game
        system's owner's manual.

    3.  Turn the power switch ON.

    4.  Press the GAME RESET lever to begin a 1-player game.  Press

                             Game Status Area

Watch this important information in the upper half of your screen:

Score
As you kick and punch your way to victory your score will increase
with each successful blow.  You will also earn points for each
enemy guarding the end of each temple level.

Timer
As time runs out this number keeps getting smaller.  When it
reaches 0 one life is over.

Your Energy Bar
The first bar, labeled PLAYER, meters your energy level.  When it
runs out one life is lost.

Enemy Energy Bar
The second bar, labeled ENEMY, meters the energy for your final
foe on each level of the temple.  You must destroy all his energy to
defeat the enemy and move on to the next level.

Lives
The head icons to the right of the energy bars represent the
number of lives remaining.  You start with four lives at the
beginning of the game.

Floor Indicator
The five squares at the bottom of the status area represent the
five levels of the Evil Wizard's temple.  The level you are currently
fighting on is represented by a flashing yellow square.  The levels
you have conquered are represented by solid yellow squares.

Note on two-player games:
Play alternates whenever a player loses a life.  The second player's
timer, and energy bars appear when the first player loses a life and
vice versa.  If one player loses all his lives, the other player continues
without interruption until the game is over.

                               Temple Enemys

Henchmen
One kick or punch knocks them out.  Don't let them get too close
or hold on to you and watch out from all sides.

Knife Throwers
Two punches or kicks will take them out.  Duck or jump to avoid
their knives.

Midgets
These tumbling trouble-makers approach from all sides.  A low kick
or punch works best or knock them with your head by jumping up
as they tumble over you.

Dragon Balls
These falling balls conceal dragons.  Destroy each ball with a single
kick or punch before it hits the ground or fight the dragon when it 
emerges.

Snake Baskets
The falling baskets hold terrible snakes.  Smash them before they
hit the ground or jump to avoid the creatures inside.

Spinning Bombs
These bombs spin for a moment and then explode in any
direction.  Move away from them to avoid their blast.

Killer Moths
These stingers will try to hurt you. Hurt them first with a kick or
punch.

The Five Masters
One is waiting for you at the end of each level.  He can't kill you
with one blow but each hit will deplete some of your energy.  If your
energy is already low when you meet him--watch out!  Here's who 
waits for you and where:
     
                  Level 1 -- Stick Fighter
                  Level 2 -- Boomerang Thrower
                  Level 3 -- Giant Kicker
                  Level 4 -- Lightning Magician
                  Level 5 -- Gang Master

Any time left at the end of a level is multiplied by 10 and added to
your score.  Any energy left at the end of a level is multiplied by 100
and added to your score.

You can win an extra life at 75,000 points.  Good luck!

                          Final Words To The Wise

Don't punch or kick without a reason.  A true Kung-Fu Master
strikes quickly and carefully.

Find your enemy's weak spot.  Learn what kind of blows hurst each
for the most.

Don't battle snakes or spinning bombs.  The best you can do is 
stay out of their way.

No single enemy blow can kill you.  (You are a Master after all.)
Each blow, however, does deplete your energy and makes you
weak.  The right blow at the wrong time CAN kill you.

Watch your timer.  When it runs out one life is lost.
