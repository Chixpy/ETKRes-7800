The Ultimate Challenge

Twin brothers Billy and Jimmy Lee learned to fight the
hard way -- for survival in the unforgiving city streets.
Their brand of combat -- classic martial arts maneuvers
mixed with anything-goes street brawling -- has turned
them into walking lethal weapons.

Now, the Lees must summon all their fighting abilities and
cunning into meeting the greatest challenge of their lives
-- rescuing Billy's girlfriend, Marion.  She's been kidnap-
ped by the Black Warriors, the savage street gang led by
the mysterious Shadow Boss.

The twins pursue the Black Warriors through the city
streets and its outskirts.  Finally they fight their way into
the Secret Enemy Base.  There, Billy and Jimmy meet the
Shadow Boss.  It's a battle to the finish, with Marion as the
prize!


Loading Instructions

  1.  With your TV off, hook up your video game system
      to your TV.

  2.  Plug in your joystick.  If you're playing a one-
      player game, use the jack on the left.

  3.  Turn on your TV, and insert the Double Dragon car-
      tridge with the label facing away from you.

  4.  Turn on the video game system.


The Battle Begins

Either one or two players can battle it out against the
Shadow Boss's henchmen.

Press the Reset button during the game to stop playing
and start a new game.

    => Elbow Punch:  Move the joystick diagonally up
       and to the right and press the left button to throw a
       left elbow punch, and diagonally up and to the left
       and press the left button to throw a right elbow

       site direction from the one you're facing.

<page 7>

Weapons

In some battles, the Black Warriors have weapons:  bats,
whips, and knives.

To knock weapons out of an enemy's hands, punch or
kick him.

To pick up a weapon, stand over it and punch.  (Press the
left button.)


Fighting It Out

   => Each player's score, remaining lives, and strength
      bar are displayed above the fighting screen.  Re-
      maining units of time and the current high score are
      also shown.

   => You get 70 units of time to make it through each of
      the first and second missions.  You get 90 units of
      time to make it through each of the third and fourth
      missions.  In the middle of the third mission, the
      timer is reset to 90 units of time.  


Watch your Strength

When you begin the fight, your strength bar is full.  As
you fight and receive blows, your strength is reduced.
When the strength bar is empty, that life is over.  When the
number of lives remaining is 0 and the strength bar has 
been drained, the game is over.

After each mission you complete (and halfway through
the third mission), your strength bar is refreshed, but you
don't earn more lives.  You must get to the Shadow Boss's
Enemy Base on your original 3 lives.


<page 8>

Scoring

The score is based on the kicks and punches you land and
the types of weapons you use:

            Action                   Points
            Punch                    50

            Knife                    500


Scenes of Battle

Billy and Jimmy Lee clash with the Black Warriors in four
different areas.  The going gets tougher as the tough get
going.

      Mission 1:  City Slums

      Mission 2:  Industrial Areas
  
      Mission 3:  Outskirts of the City
 
      Mission 4:  The Enemy Base of the Shadow Boss


<page 9>

Battle Strategy

   => You can't drop your weapon, but it can be taken
      away from you during the heat of battle.  Keep your
      distance while slugging it out.

   => Don't squander your lives early on!  You'll defi-
      nitely need all your strength once you're locked in     
      battle with the Shadow Boss.

   => Keep an eye on the timer.  If your time runs out
      before you polish off your opponent, you lose a life.
      If it's your last life, the game is over.
