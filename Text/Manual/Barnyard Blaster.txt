Have a Blast!

     You and your grandpa just put your life savings into buying a small farm-
-a few acres for growing vegetables and raising horses, a place to get away 
from the battle of city life.
     As the two of your settle in on the back porch, you notice a couple of 
small critters scurrying across the cornfield.  Then you hear squeaks and 
squawks coming from the barn.  Horror of horrors!  Your entire farm is 
infested with vermin determined to drive you away!
     It's you or them.  With your trusty gun in hand, you head for the 
barnyard.  Gramps backs you all the way.  You'll show them you're no city 
slouch!


Getting Started

1.  With your Atari 7800 set up, insert the Barnyard Blaster cartridge into 
    the console.  Plug your Atari XG-1 light gun into the left controller port 
    on the front of your console.  (In a two-player game, players share on 
    light gun.)

2.  Turn on your television, and press the [Power] key to turn on the console. 
    The Barnyard Blaster title screen will appear.  Aim the light gun at the 
    screen and shoot to view the game options:  bales of hay with a one-player 
    or two-player game option.  (If you don't shoot the title screen, the game 
    options screen will automatically appear in a few seconds.)

3.  Holding the light gun three to five feet from the screen, aim and shoot 
    at the bale for the option you choose.

4.  To pause the game, press [Pause].  To return to the title screen, press 
    [Reset].

5.  To turn the music on or off, press [Select].


Playing the Game

     Your goal is to rid your farm of vermin by shooting targets in each of 
three areas:  the barnyard, the cornfield, and the barn.  You aim and shoot 
your light gun to hit static and moving targets on the screen.  You have up to 
40 bullets per screen, so aim accurately to avoid wasting precious ammunition.
     In order to advance through each area, you must achieve a certain 
percentage of shooting accuracy in that area.  Each time you finish one area 
of the farm, your scores are displayed:  your score for that screen, your bonus
bullet score based on the number of spares, and your total game score.  You 
can shoot the score screen to advance to the next screen, or you can wait for 
it to advance automatically.
     A fourth area of the farm--Gramps' bonus screen--gives you a chance to 
brush up on your target shooting and earn extra points.  This screen appears 
each time you leave other areas of the farm.
     If you make it through all three areas, you'll make the rounds again and 
again, with each round more challenging than the last.  At the end of the 
game, you'll be given one of 13 possible target-shooting ranks, from Total 
Dud, the lowest, to Blaster, the highest.

The Farm Layout

     Barnyard Blaster provides four screens on which to practice your shooting 
skills.
     
The Barnyard
     
     In the barnyard, bottles and cans lines up on a fence offer great 
practice for warming up the old shootin' iron.  This is your target practice 
area.  Watch for the gopher, who may appear in the field behind the tree.  
He's a quick little fellow.  (The gopher can appear on all four of the 
different screens.)

The Cornfield

     In the cornfield, you'll aim at static targets--watermelons and pumpkins-
-and moving targets--crows and rabbits.  You must shoot the veggies before you 
can get the moving critters.

The Barn

     As you enter the barn, all sorts of critters will skitter across the 
floor.  Occasionally, birds will swoop down.

Gramps' Bonus Screen

     On the bonus screen, Gramps will throw 10 bottles into the air to help 
you hone your shooting skills.  Shoot each bottle before it disappears.  But 
don't shoot poor Gramps.  If you do, the bonus round will end.


Scoring

     In each area of the farm, points range from 10 to 250, depending on the 
target and how quickly you hit it.  The smaller and faster the target, the 
more points it's worth.
