WHICH WAY TO THE CASTLE?

Over scorching deserts, through dark icy caverns, around a 
fiery volcano, and under the leafy cover of a steamy jungle, 
you set out with three brave friends to retrieve the treasures 
stolen by the Evil Master.  Your goal is his castle far, far, 
away.

Your friends are lightly armed, but you carry your trusty 
crossbow.  By shooting its swift arrows, you can save yourself 
and your companions from the dangerous attacks of the Evil 
Master's creatures -- scorpions, ants, pterodactyls, voracious 
plants, bats, snakes, and other horrible beings.

When you reach the castle, the Evil Master's expert archers 
await you, ready to test their aim with deadly arrows.  Inside 
the castle, a fierce dragon also waits, gurading the treasure 
with its fiery breath.

Few adventurers have dared to make thie trek.  No one yet has 
come back alive.

GETTING STARTED

1. With your Atari 7800 set up, insert the Crossbow cartridge 
into the console and plug a joystick or light gun into the 
left port.

2. Turn on your television and press [Power] to turn on your 
Atari console.  The Crossbow title and selection screen appears.

3. Press [Select] to change the controller option if desired

4. Press the fire button or [Reset] to start the game.  The 
Map screen comes up.

5. Using your light gun, choose a path by shooting at either 
the red or green path box at the bottom of the screen.  If you 
are using a joystick, use it to move the cursor.  If you 
prefer, you can wait a few moments, and a path will be chosen 
for you.

6. Holding the light gun three to five feet from the 
television, aim and shoot at the Evil Master's creatures 
before they attack your friends.  Your gun acts as your 
crossbow.  If you are using a joystick, use it to move the 
cursor.

7. Press [Pause] to pause a game.  Press it again to resume 
play.

8. Press [Reset] at any time to start a new game or press 
[Select] to return to the title screen.

PLAYING THE GAME

Starting Your Adventure

Your adventure begins on the Map screen.  This screen shows 
the eight Danger Zones you must pass through to reach the 
treasures.

You have to figure out which paths to take to reach the castle 
and claim the treasures.  Begin by shooting with either the 
gun or the joystick at either the red or green path box.  A 
path appears that leads you to your first Danger Zone.

Protecting Your Friends

Once you get to a Danger Zone, the Evil Master's creatures 
immediately begin attacking your friends.  If attacked, your 
friends dissolve.  To stop the loathsome creatures, you must 
shoot them with your gun or joystick.  If you are using a gun, 
move the gun sight onto a creature to aim, and then shoot.  If 
you are using a joystick, use it to move the cursor.

If you escort your friends safely through a Danger Zone, you 
return to the Map screen and choose a path once again.  This 
time you choose a red, green, or blue path to arrive at a 
Danger Zone.

Once an adventurer dissolves, that friend is lost forever.  If 
all adventurers are lost, your quest ends.  When you make it 
safely through a Danger Zone, the survivors and, in some 
Danger Zones, a bonus friend will appear.

If you rescue the treasures, you confront the Evil Master 
himself.  Fire at his red eyes to complete your quest, return 
to the Map screen, and start again.

The Danger Zones

You start your trek with three adventuresome friends.  You 
gain a new friend the first time you make it safely through 
each Danger Zone, except the Village and the Castle, up to a 
maximum of eight adventurers at one time.

In the Desert, your friends are attacked by deadly scorpions, 
vultures, snakes, and ants.  You gain another friend the first 
time you survive this zone.

While wandering through the Caverns, watch out for swooping 
bats, falling stalactites, and a ghastly ghost.  Shoot down 
the two hanging stalactites to fill in the crevices in the 
path so you can get across.  Another friend joins you the 
first time you make it safely through the Caverns.

The Volcano spews burning rocks and fiery lava, so watch out.  
Shoot the resting rock to make a bridge over the lava river.  
Passing by the volcano safely for the first time earns you 
another friend.

In the steaming depths of the Jungle, wicked monkeys hurl 
coconuts and toucans with deadly aim.  Voracious plants lie in 
wait for the adventurers.  The first time you survive the 
Jungle Zone, you are joined by a new friend.

In the Village, the horrors of the night await.  From the 
street, sinister agents appear in the windows, wolves pop up 
out of nowhere, and even the street lights are controlled by 
the Evil Master.  From above, chilling chosts attack, deadly 
lightning bolts fall, and a cruel witch appears on rooftops, 
ready to drop devastating fireballs.  In this unfriendly 
village, no bonus friends can join you.

At the River, the scenery is beautiful, but perils await you 
every step of the way.  You are threatened on the bridge by 
mighty bouncing boulders and swooping pterodactyls.  The Evil 
Master has many spies here.  YOu'll find jumping fish, hungry 
alligators, and slime monsters n the river, leaping frogs on 
the riverbank, and a bird hidden in the tree.

If you're not careful, you might just meet your match at the 
Drawbridge, where the Evil Master's loyal archers and 
pterodactyls try to stop you.  Hungry alligators wait in the 
moat, snapping their jaws at you.  To enter the castle, shoot 
through the two ropes holding up the drawbridge.

At the Castle Hall, a dragon breathes fire, daggers drop from 
the ceiling, and arrows fly from the walls.  A trapdoor is 
your last barrier to claiming the treasures -- shoot the 
statue's flashing staff to open it.

Shoot the Evil Master's Eye that appears once on every screen 
to gain bonus points.

If you make it past the Castle Hall, you confront the Evil 
Master himself.  Here he makes his last fearsome attempt to do 
you in and reclaim the treasures.  Your only hope is to shoot 
his eyes when they glow red.
