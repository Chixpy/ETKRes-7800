     In Main Event, you'll fight against a series of eleven contenders, each 
one more powerful than the last.
     In Training, you'll use the controller to train these powerhouses in 
punching, footwork, and timing.
     In Sparring Match, your fighters will practice what they've learned in 
training in a match against the computer.
     In Tournament, you and a friend can take up your best boxers to fight 
each other's stars in round robin order.  This is a player vs. player event.

Training

     Before your boxers fight, they'll want to train.  With Training, you can 
practice using your controller to perfect your offensive and defensive boxing 
strategies.  After selecting a boxer for training, you'll choose a training 
mode:  Follow (the computer requests your moves) or Lead (you choose your own 
moves).  You'll then pick a training speed, displayed on a speed bar.  When 
you determine your boxer is ready, he can continue his training under Sparring 
Match by practicing his strategy against the computer.


In the Ring

     In Main Event, Sparring Match, and Tournament, your boxer will compete 
against other contenders for a score.  The top of the screen displays each 
boxer's name, picture, score, and KO (Knock Out) bar, as well as the round 
number and a clock. 
     The object of the fight is to knock out or "KO" the contender by landing 
blows to his face and body, while avoiding similar blows.  Each time a fighter 
lands a blow, his score goes up and his opponent's KO bar increases.
     There are three rounds to a match, each round lasts three minutes.  Your 
points accumulate through each round.  If neither is KO'd by the end of the 
match, the player with the highest number of points wins.

Scoring

     When you score points and how many points you score depends on the boxer 
you're facing.  Each boxer has a different point value for each punch (jab, 
body blow, or superblow) and resistance value for each blow.

     Your boxer's guard position determines the degree of damage.  If his 
guard is up when his contender lands a jab, or down when he lands a body blow, 
the amount of damage caused by a punch is zero.
     You can win extra points by stepping into a punch, fewer points for 
stepping out of a punch.
